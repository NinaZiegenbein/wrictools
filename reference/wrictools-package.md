# wrictools: Analyze Whole Room Indirect Calorimetry (WRIC) Data

Provides functions, tutorials, and examples to preprocess, analyze, and
visualize data from whole room indirect calorimeters (WRIC) by
Maastricht Instruments, using the 'OmniCal' software. Some functions may
also work with WRICs from other manufacturers, though full functionality
has only been validated for Maastricht Instruments devices.
