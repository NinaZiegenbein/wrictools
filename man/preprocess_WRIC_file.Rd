\title{Preprocesses a wric data file, extracting metadata, creating DataFrames, and optionally saving results.}
\usage{
preprocess_wric_file(
  filepath,
  code = "id",
  manual = NULL,
  save_csv = FALSE,
  path_to_save = NULL,
  combine = TRUE,
  method = "mean",
  start = NULL,
  end = NULL,
  notefilepath = NULL,
  keywords_dict = NULL,
  entry_exit_dict = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filepath}{Path to the wric .txt file.}

\item{code}{Method for generating subject IDs ("id", "id+comment", "study+id" (only for software v2), or "manual").}

\item{manual}{Custom codes for subjects in Room 1 and Room 2 if \code{code} is "manual".}

\item{save_csv}{Logical, whether to save extracted metadata and data to CSV files.}

\item{path_to_save}{Directory path for saving CSV files, NULL uses the current directory.}

\item{combine}{Logical, whether to combine S1 and S2 measurements.}

\item{method}{Method for combining measurements ("mean", "median", "s1", "s2", "min", "max").}

\item{start}{character or POSIXct or NULL, rows before this will be removed, if NULL takes first row e.g "2023-11-13 11:43:00"}

\item{end}{character or POSIXct or NULL, rows after this will be removed, if NULL takes last row e.g "2023-11-13 11:43:00"}

\item{notefilepath}{String, Directory path of the corresponding note file (.txt)}

\item{keywords_dict}{List,
A dictionary of keywords used to extract protocol events from a note file. Each entry should be a named list with:
\describe{
\item{keywords}{A character vector of keywords or phrases to match in the note comment. Matching is case-insensitive.}
\item{value}{Numeric protocol value to assign when the keyword is detected.}
\item{type}{Optional character, either "instant" or omitted. "instant" events are applied at the specified timestamp and revert to the previous protocol immediately after. Non-instant events set the protocol until another event occurs.}
}
Behavior rules:
\describe{
\item{Non-instant events}{Set the protocol value from their timestamp until another event overwrites it or until a stop keyword sets it to 0.}
\item{Instant events}{Apply only at the timestamp of the note line, then revert to the protocol that was active immediately before.}
\item{Stop keywords}{Always set the protocol to 0, regardless of previous state, unless overridden by an instant event.}
}
If \code{NULL}, a default set of keywords is used.}

\item{entry_exit_dict}{Nested List, used to extract entry/exit times from note file}
}
\value{
list
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{version}{Character string indicating the detected software version
(\code{"1"} for old software, \code{"2"} for new software).}
\item{metadata}{A named list containing extracted metadata.
For version 1, this includes \code{r1} and \code{r2}.
For version 2, this contains a single \code{metadata} entry.}
\item{dfs}{A named list containing processed data frames.
For version 1: \code{room1} and \code{room2}.
For version 2: \code{data}.}
