Description: Provides functions, tutorials, and examples to preprocess, 
    analyze, and visualize data from whole room indirect calorimeters (WRIC) by 
    Maastricht Instruments, using the 'OmniCal' software. Some functions may also 
    work with WRICs from other manufacturers, though full functionality has only 
    been validated for Maastricht Instruments devices.
